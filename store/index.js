            description: '<p class="pb-4">I built this feature by calling a pricing endpoint that returns a heavily nested pricing struct. I wrote a helper function that loops through multiple layer of properties extracting prices for each cabin type, available promos, promo type, and finally tallies the values of each data point to run an across-the-board comparison. Despite it\'s look, I was able to achieve this without using a table. I created a parent component that houses column components which converts to a tab view on smaller screens.This also allows cabin types to be hidden when they are not available. This project started out as a simple wireframe that I had sketched out, but iterated into a pretty complex UI. With the interest of multiple stakeholders, the design had to pivot a few times (even in the middle of development), but the end result has proven to be a key component to drive leads into our network.</p>',
